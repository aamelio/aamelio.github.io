      <title>  Social Learning, Behavioral Biases and Group Outcomes</title>

      <description>In many relevant decision contexts, individuals are affected by a wide array of behavioral biases. Additionally, individuals often have the chance to observe others’ decisions and, possibly, change theirs. This paper investigates the impact of social learning on a broad range of behavioral biases, reflecting economically relevant settings. Through an online experiment, I document how social learning can amplify errors stemming from behavioral biases, leading to worse group outcomes. For some tasks, unbiased participants are more likely to imitate biased ones, leading to an amplification of the errors. A misalignment between performance and relative confidence drives this detrimental effect of social learning on group outcomes. These results shed light on settings where cognitive biases affect decision-making in the presence of social learning, such as the interpretation of statistical information or investment decisions. My results suggest that social learning often does not eliminate, and will in fact sometimes exacerbate, the impact of cognitive biases in such settings.</description>

      <title>  Contigent Belief Updating</title>

      <description>We study how contingent thinking – that is, reasoning through all possible contingencies without knowing which is realized – affects belief updating. According to the Bayesian benchmark, beliefs updated after exposure to new information should be equivalent to beliefs assessed for the contingency of receiving such information. Using an experiment, we decompose the effect of contingent thinking on belief updating into two components: (1) hypothetical thinking (updating on a piece of not-yet-observed information) and (2) contrast reasoning (comparing multiple contingencies during the updating process).</description>

      <title> Can Information Be Too Much? Information Source Selection and Beliefs</title>

      <description>Agents undertaking economic decisions are exposed to an ever-increasing amount of information sources, especially nowadays in what has been defined as the Information Age. This paper investigates how the number of available information sources impacts agents’ ability to (i) select reliable sources and (ii) use their content effectively to update their beliefs. To answer these questions, I set up an online experiment informed by a simple automata decision-making and belief-updating model.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Uncertainty and Overconfidence</title>
      <link>https://aamelio.github.io/research/2_cogunc/</link>

      <description>Overconfidence is one of the most ubiquitous cognitive bias. There is copious evidence of overconfidence being relevant in a diverse set of economic domains. In this paper, we relate the recent concept of cognitive uncertainty with overconfidence. Cognitive uncertainty represents a decision maker&amp;rsquo;s uncertainty about her action optimality. We present a simple model of overconfidence based on the concept of cognitive uncertainty. The model relates the concepts theoretically and generates testable predictions.</description>
