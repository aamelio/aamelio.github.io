      <description>In many relevant decision contexts, we are affected by a wide array of behavioral biases. Also, we often have the chance to observe othersâ€™ decisions and, possibly, change ours. This paper investigates the impact of social learning on a broad range of behavioral biases, reflecting economically relevant settings. Through an online experiment, I document how social learning can amplify errors stemming from behavioral biases, leading to worse group outcomes. For some tasks, high-performing participants are more likely to imitate low-performing participants, while the opposite holds for the latter, leading to an amplification of the bias.</description>
